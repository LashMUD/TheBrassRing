2020-04-15
*/lib/lib/potion.c clean up coding a bit and added comments

2016-03-16
*/lib/lib/genetics.c
 -removed stupid SetBlind() function because:
 -removed static type from RemoveBlindness() function: now it can be called
   by an admin to remove blindness if character is blinded
 -added functionality to eventBlind() function so it returns the messages coded
   when using the eventBlind() function like so: 
   target->eventBlind( target, 20, ({"Suddenly you can't see a damn thing!", "Your
   sight returns!"}) );
   interestingly, the message output has to be coded in reverse of what I thought
   was intuitive - the end[1] message is returned when blinded and the end[0]
   message is returned after the timer for blindness expires. wtf?
*/lib/damon/seasons.c
 -changed varargs int GetYearLength(int x) to int GetYearLength(). I don't know
   what I was thinking, if at all.

2016-03-15
*/lib/secure/lib/connect.c and connect.real
 -added checks to eventCompleteChar(). Get different ending output for player
  characters or creator characters if AUTO_WIZ is enabled

2016-03-12
*/lib/powers/npc - cleaned up magic_user.c

2016-03-07
*/lib/secure/daemon/players.c
 -changed levelling requirements using the GetBaseSkillLevel() function
   so that leveling does not take into account skill bonuses if present
 -In /lib/lib/lvs/abilities.c the GetSkillLevel() function is set up to
   return base and bonus skill levels
*removed changes that I added to /lib/lib/sentient.c and /lib/lib/std/vendor.c
  weren't quite working the way I thought they would

2016-03-02
*/lib/secure/daemon/players in CheckAdvance(object ob)
 -changed leveling requirements
   level is dependent on gaining skill levels: 12 points x character level
 -advancement depends on addition of highest 3 primary, 2 secondary and 
   1 minor skill. 12 additional points required to advance to level 2, 
   another 12 for level 3 and so on
*/lib/lib/combat.c
 -altered CanMelee() and CanWeapon() functions
 -altered EventMeleeAttack() so only one damage value is returned

 -included the Protection variable in the my_save array so the armor
   ProtectionMap is saved with the item. Otherwise the player can log out
   and back in again and get all new armor.

   be able to tell when their equipment is messed up, right?
