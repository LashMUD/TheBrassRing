2020-04-15
*/lib/lib/potion.c clean up coding a bit and added comments

2016-03-16
*/lib/lib/genetics.c
 -removed stupid SetBlind() function because:
 -removed static type from RemoveBlindness() function: now it can be called
   by an admin to remove blindness if character is blinded
 -added functionality to eventBlind() function so it returns the messages coded
   when using the eventBlind() function like so: 
   target->eventBlind( target, 20, ({"Suddenly you can't see a damn thing!", "Your
   sight returns!"}) );
   interestingly, the message output has to be coded in reverse of what I thought
   was intuitive - the end[1] message is returned when blinded and the end[0]
   message is returned after the timer for blindness expires. wtf?
*/lib/daemon/seasons.c
 -changed varargs int GetYearLength(int x) to int GetYearLength(). I don't know
   what I was thinking, if at all.

2016-03-15
*/lib/secure/lib/connect.c and connect.real
 -added checks to eventCompleteChar(). Get different ending output for player
  characters or creator characters if AUTO_WIZ is enabled

*/lib/powers/npc - cleaned up magic_user.c

2016-03-07

   return base and bonus skill levels
*removed changes that I added to /lib/lib/sentient.c and /lib/lib/std/vendor.c
  weren't quite working the way I thought they would

2016-03-02
*/lib/secure/daemon/players in CheckAdvance(object ob)
 -changed leveling requirements
   level is dependent on gaining skill levels: 12 points x character level
 -advancement depends on addition of highest 3 primary, 2 secondary and 
   1 minor skill. 12 additional points required to advance to level 2, 
   another 12 for level 3 and so on
*/lib/lib/combat.c
 -altered CanMelee() and CanWeapon() functions

   ProtectionMap is saved with the item. Otherwise the player can log out
