Setup - I currently use Linux Mint x64 as my operating system.

download the dead souls mud library from http://dead-souls.net

compile dead souls per instructions and start the mud

connect and login as an admin character

logout and kill the mud processes: "startmud" and "driver"

replace the files in the ds3.9/lib directories with the files in this 
repository. BACKUP THE ORIGINAL FILES FIRST

Additionally, files in this lib use an hour length of 1200 and
a day length of 24. Time based functions in files that are in, or called
by the heart_beat function, will need to be changed to adapt to the time
style of your Dead Souls mudlib, or the set_day_length and set hour_length
can be changed in /lib/secure/include/config.h 

Edit /lib/secure/include/config.h as follows:

#define ADMIN_EMAIL              "n@n.net" to your email address
#define DEBUGGER                 "lash" to your admin name

start the mud again - login as the admin character and you may issue the following 
commands:

mudconfig selectclass no or yes
 if yes the player can choose a pregenerated class or select their own skills
 if no then they select their own skills by default

mudconfig selectskills yes

mudconfig xpadvancement no
 player still gains xp - may use in future to trade in for perks

mudconfig skilladvancement yes

mudconfig autoadvance yes
 if no then see the modified dirk.c file in /lib/domains/town/npc folder.
 Dirk is coded to advance players based on skill point levels.

use admintool to add goat as a race

warmboot

connect and create a test character - you should now be able to select primary,
secondary and minor skills for your test character.
