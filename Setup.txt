Setup - I currently use Linux Mint x64 as my operating system.

1. download the dead souls mud library from http://dead-souls.net

2. compile dead souls per instructions and start the mud

3. connect and login as an admin character

4. logout and kill the mud processes: "startmud" and "driver"

5. replace the files in the ds3.9/lib directories with the files in this 
   repository. BACKUP THE ORIGINAL FILES FIRST

6. start the mud again - login as the admin character and issue the following 
   commands:
   mudconfig selectclass no
   mudconfig selectskills yes
   mudconfig xpadvancement no
   mudconfig skilladvancement yes
   warmboot

7. connect and create a test character - you should now be able to select primary,
   secondary and other skills for your test character
