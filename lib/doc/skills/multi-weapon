Multi-weapon is an offensive skill that enables the player character to use
multiple weapon attacks when wielding a weapon in each hand. Players without
this skill do poorer in combat when duel armed. It is a good skill to have in
combination with multi-hand. It is used in conjunction with the coordination
stat of the player. The higher the skill level the more damage you will inflict
on your opponents.
