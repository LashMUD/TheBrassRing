Multi-hand is an offensive skill that enables the player character to use
multiple weapon attacks more efficiently when wielding a weapon in each hand.
Players without this skill do poorer in combat when duel armed. It is a good
skill to have in combination with mult-weapon. Players who wish to play a 
swashbuckling type character archetype might want to choose this skill. 
The higher the skill level the more damage you will inflict on your opponents.
