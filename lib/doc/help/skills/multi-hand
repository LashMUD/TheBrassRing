Multi-hand is an offensive skill that enables the player character to use 
two-handed weapons or wield two weapons (one in each hand) without incurring a
penalty. Players without this skill do worse in combat when using two-handed
weapons or trying to wield two weapons simultaneously. It is an advantageous
skill to have in conjunction with multi-weapon. Players who wish to play a
swashbuckling character archetype might want to choose this skill. The higher
the skill level, the more chance you have to hit a target when wielding 
two-handed weapons or two weapons at the same time.
