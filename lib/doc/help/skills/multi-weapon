Multi-weapon is an offensive skill that enables the player character to use
multiple weapon attacks when wielding a weapon in each hand without penalty. 
Players without this skill do poorer in combat when duel armed. It is a good
skill to have in combination with multi-hand. Players who wish to play a 
swashbuckling type character archetype might want to choose this skill.
The higher the skill level the more damage you will inflict on your opponents.
