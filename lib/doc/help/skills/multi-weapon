Multi-weapon is an offensive skill that enables the player character to use
multiple weapon attacks when wielding a weapon in each hand without penalty.
Players without this skill do worse in combat when duel-armed. It is a good
skill to have in conjunction with multi-hand. This skill may be appropriate
players who wish to play swashbuckling character archetype. The higher the
skill level, the better chance you have to hit your opponent.
