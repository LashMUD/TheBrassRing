Stealth is a skill that allows the player-character to be more
efficient at sneaking around without being detected. Stealth allows players to
track or evade opponents after being in combat with them. It is  a good skill
to have in combination with the stealing skill. Players who want to play a
thief type archetype may find this skill useful.
