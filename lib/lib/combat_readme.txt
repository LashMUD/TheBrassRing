I've rearranged the contents of /lib/lib/combat.c and comments 
describing what the different functions do.

combat_r_o.c is the original combat.c file in the dead souls mudlib rearranged

combat.c is the modified file

You can do a diff on both files to see the modifications I've made to combat.

By the way, I use the program "meld" (https://meldmerge.org) to do diffs
