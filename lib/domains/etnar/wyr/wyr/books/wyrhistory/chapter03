chapter 3 "The Horde"

   Weeks later, after the cataclysm, the hordes from the north arrived. 
Displaced from their homelands, they ravaged the fertile plains and lush 
forests of the southern Province of Char. Wyr was invaded and decimated. Most
of the village folk were slaughtered, but a few escaped to the Brambelwood and
were lost. There is rumour that some of these folk took up residence in 
Sellnor Monestery, but that has not been confirmed. 

   The horde took over the western branch of Fairhaven among the hills. There
is no report concerning the fate of the miners and their families. Trolls, 
ogres, orcs, kobolds and other nameless things roamed freely throughout the
woods, hunting its game and felling trees for their infernal fires. A dark
cloud hung over the hills.
 
   People who ventured into that area of the wood seldom returned. Those that
did return related almost unspeakable horrors and speculated that an unnatural
force was used to bind the horde together in an unstoppable mass. The woods of
Fairhaven became known as the Vexwood for this reason. 

Yet the horde was eventually stopped.
