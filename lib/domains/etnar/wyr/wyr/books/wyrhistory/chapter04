chapter 4 "A Hero"

   A grizzled old war veteran by the name of Eflam laid claim to the eastern
half of the Vexwood. Arriving on the shoreline of Char Province where the 
Wyrpul once emptied into the ocean, Eflam and his followers began construction
of a fortified keep. He was charged by the Earl of Q'in to keep the horde from 
advancing up the coastline.

  Like most folk from Q'in, Eflam was an imposing figure. Not tall of stature,
but built solidly with ebony tanned skin, as is wont for their people.
