chapter 2 "The Old Times"

   Many generations past, a cataclysm shook the south. The wind roared and the 
earth buckled. Riverbeds changed their courses and mountains sprang into 
existence where farmlands and fields once stood. The river Wyrpul ceased to 
flow and the lives of the village folk in Wyr were greatly affected. 

   River Wyrpul was the life blood of the village. Leading southeasterly 
through the Fairhaven woods, now known as the Vexwood, Wyrpul emptied into the
Valeria ocean. The cargo of trading vessels held the bounty of Wyr - stout
lumber logged from the Bramblewood to the north, hearty grains grown from the 
fertile fields, casks of strong brew fermented from the grains, and precious
ore mined from the hills in the deeps of Fairhaven. 

   Most precious of all were the favored r'nirr stones. These emerald gems
held a latent power that was used to harness the Aura of the Psion. And these
goods were traded and sold up and down the eastern seaboard, or shipped north
up the Wyrpul to the city of Orgon that lay on the Farkasa bay.
