This the doamin for the continent of Etnar which is expected to have several
regions. The village of Wyr and its surroundings is one of them. Other regions
will be the lands of Q'in and Char.

Wyr is the main village I am currently working on and will be updated and 
changed frequently. Other places in the region will include:

*The Bramblewood Forest containing:
 * a ruined monestary to explore with a quest
 * logging parties
 * the Three Sisters mountains with an area to explore
 * the ruins of the Morganheifer Mansion
 * the witches hut
*The Vexwood Forest containing:
 * a ruined keep to explore with a quest
 * the hideout of Falkner Glover the bandit who has been raiding the caravans 
   between Wyr and Orgon
 * the land of Gast - a region of great horror that drove out the elves
   of the Mountains of Fairhaven (now called the Vexwood forest) 
*The town of Orgon to the northwest of Wyr

And other areas.
